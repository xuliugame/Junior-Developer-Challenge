//so that can help other developers to know what your code does when they see your code.

//Does this code make sense? I think it makes sense but also doesn't make sense. 
// Because this code uses js to manipulate DOM nodes and add style attributes to DOM nodes.
// It also doesn't make sense because their have easy way to finish it's feature, and some of part are very confuse.
